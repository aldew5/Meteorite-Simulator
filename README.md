# Meteorite-Simulator
A meteorite simulator built in Python as part of my IB Extended Essay project. It assumes a spherical meteroite of uniform density. It factors in ablation due to friction with air particles, variable acceleration due to gravity, and temperature fluctuations. 

It was built to determine the kinetic energy of the meteorite that created the Sudbury Basin over 1.8 billion years ago. The results are summarized in the attached paper. It received an A from the IB Organization.
